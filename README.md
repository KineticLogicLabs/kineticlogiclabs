## About the Project
**Kinetic Logic Labs** is a digital portfolio and resource hub dedicated to the intersection of mechanical engineering, 3D printing, and competitive science. 

The goal of this website is to document the "Digital Logic" behind physical machines—showing the transition from a concept in CAD to a functioning prototype on the workbench. It serves as a showcase of my work in **Science Olympiad**, technical design, and hardware modification.

## What’s Inside
This site hosts a variety of resources designed for students, makers, and engineering enthusiasts:

* **Engineering Portfolios:** Visual breakdowns of design iterations for Science Olympiad events like *Mission Possible*.
* **3D Printing Workflows:** Technical insights into optimizing prints for high-performance hardware like the **Bambu Lab P1S**.
* **Open Documentation:** Shared research and process papers for academic projects, including National History Day (NHD).
* **Maker Resources:** A library of custom-designed components and hardware solutions developed in **Autodesk Fusion**.

## The Philosophy
At Kinetic Logic Labs, the focus is on **transparency in engineering**. 
I believe that the most valuable part of any project isn't the final product, but the "Failed Versions" and the logic used to overcome them. This site aims to democratize those resources, providing a roadmap for others to learn, adapt, and build their own kinetic systems.
